# Current format for the lab

- one or two large projects
- at least one small project
- one long-running project with small features that can be added

# Large Project

- usually has a full-stack component
- has one "lead" dev
- takes 4 to 6 weeks
- e.g. Quote Chat, Many Faced God

# Small Project

- taken on by one or two people (pair programming) 
- takes ~2 weeks
- there can be a backlog of project descriptions that people can pick up, OR attendees can work on a project that _they_ would like to take on, and the organizer can help them scope it
    - in this case, organizer and attendee can have a short pre-lab scoping meeting (phone or in-person)
- e.g. Speak to Click

# Long-Running Project

- ongoing
- can have small (single day) independent features added
- e.g. Nimbus UI
