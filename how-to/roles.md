# Lab Roles

## Organizer

e.g. Nima!

The organizer plans the sessions (when/where will they happen, who knows about them, etc.) and manages the projects. This includes:
- scoping out features
- creating issues and assigning people to them
- making tech stack choices
- mentoring
- code reviews and managing pull requests

## Lead

Someone who has attended the lab multiple times, and is comfortable taking on a project with minimal guidance. This person works mainly on one "large" project, following issues that the organizer has opened on GitHub. They are the "project owners", and are encouraged to challenge the organizer's opinions. Being a lead is a good opportunity to provide mentorship to a "junior", e.g. through pair programming.

## Junior

Someone who is attending the lab for the first 2 or 3 times. May require a bit of help getting started. Probably best to join a Lead in pair-programming on a feature for a large project, or taking on a small feature for a long-running project in their first session. Can then choose to work on a small project, or to continue contributing to a large project or long-running project until they feel ready to be a lead.
