# How to run the Alumni Lab

Running the lab happens in several phases.

- Starting the lab
- Starting a project
- Day-to-day
- Maintaining projects
- Finishing projects
- sourcing attendees
- scheduling frequent meetings
- how to cater to attendee requests
- curating a remote contribution workflow
- documenting what you're producing + doing

## Starting the Lab

## Sourcing Attendees

Depending on the availability of space and your current workload, you may want to limit the number of attendees. This can be done by keeping the lab a secret, and only extending invitations to job-seeking alumni and recent grads. I try to keep a steady cap of 6 people each week. As people find jobs or become unavailable, you can ask Career Services and the education team to extend invitations to potential attendees. The easiest way to keep track of who's coming is with something like Eventbrite.

Pitching for Projects

- contributors can propose projects! Small projects can be pitched day-of. Large projects can be pitched, and then considered for the next cycle. If a pitched project is too big, then it may be considered for a long-running project.
