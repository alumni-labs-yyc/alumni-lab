## Mode

We'll have to figure this out together. Here's an init:

- meet weekly? at the Central Library on Saturdays? 11am
- come at 11am, leave whenever you want? I'll be leaving at 1pm-ish
- stand up meeting from 11:05am - 11:20am, to set the tone for the day.
- do stuffs ...

## What Stuffs?

We will always have at least one project we're all working on.
