name: Oauth 2.0
​
what is it?
  - OAuth is about authorization and not authentication
  - an 'authorization framework'
​
what is it used for?
  - enables 3rd party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service
  - For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe.
​
what could we build? 
  - any modern app that requires a registration and login prior to full access to the features of the app.
