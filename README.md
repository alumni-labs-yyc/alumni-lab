# Lighthouse Labs Alumni Lab

Welcome to the Alumni Lab!

The goals of this lab:

- work on cool projects in a group
- develop our skills as software developers
- explore cool technologies!
- "do good"

Overview:

- Once a week for 3 hours
- Show up with your own projects, or come to pick up a project
- Your own projects stay closed source, or whatever license you'd like to keep
- Projects started in the lab are open source

Roles:

- wireframing
- user stories
- code reviewers
- pair programmers
- QA + testing
- Continuous integration / deployment
- front end
- back end

Stacks:

Main ones that I would like to focus on are:

- Typescript
- React + Express
- React + Rails
- React Native

I'm interested in exploring other tech as well, as we see fit.

Project ideas:

- Let's grab some open source thing and take some tickets
- Final-project style, kick off a project
- Chrome extensions
- Web apps
- Games
- Hardware stuff??
- Blockchain
- Starcraft deepmind teams (Alphastar) http://wiki.sc2ai.net/Main_Page

The first session will need to be an ideation session for the most part, exploring what people are interested in and then forming the session around that. Once some projects get kicked off, then there will be more stuff for people to pick up when they drop in.

Should people do work outside of lab time? They can! I will maintain the projects, and they can submit pull requests.

Ideas for the first project:

- Random food order app
- Guitar tabs website
- Location-based voice chat app
- Jetify (with the group's permission)

Generally formed around buzzwords:

- GraphQL
- Serverless
- etc.
