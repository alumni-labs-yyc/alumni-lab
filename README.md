# Lighthouse Labs Alumni Lab

Welcome to the Alumni Lab!

The goals of this lab:

- Have fun being better developers by doing:
  - Code more
  - Learn new stack or tools
  - Practice good habits
    - Documentation
    - Testing
    - Code reviews
    - Agile
  - Practice / Exposure to dev workflows
    - DevOps
    - Planning
    - Estimation
  - whatever else we think appropriate
    + beers plus pizza??

Overview:

- Once a biweekly for 3 hours (Saturdays?)
- Show up with your own projects, or come to pick up a project
- Your own projects stay closed source, or whatever license you'd like to keep
- Projects started in the lab are open source

## Mode

We'll have to figure this out together. Here's an init:

- meet biweekly? at the ~~Central Library~~ Edison? on Saturdays? 11am
- come at 11am, leave whenever you want? I'll be leaving at 2pm-ish
- stand up meeting from 11:05am - 11:20am, to set the tone for the day.
- do stuffs ...

## Roles

What roles could look like:

- wireframing
- user stories
- code reviewers
- pair programmers
- QA + testing
- DevOps
- front end
- back end

## Stacks

Main ones that I would like to start with are:

- React + Express / Koa
- React Native

We would explore other tech as we see fit.

## Project ideas

- Let's grab some open source thing and take some tickets
- Final-project style, kick off a project
- Chrome extensions
- Chatbots
- Web apps
- Games
- Robotics
- Hardware stuff??
- Blockchain
- Starcraft deepmind teams (Alphastar) http://wiki.sc2ai.net/Main_Page

The first session will need to be an ideation session for the most part, exploring what people are interested in and then forming the session around that. Once some projects get kicked off, then there will be more stuff for people to pick up when they drop in.

Should people do work outside of lab time? They can! I will maintain the projects, and they can submit pull requests.

Ideas for the first project:

- Random food order app
- Video bookmarking app
- Pluggable widgets library
- Other ideas you bring with you to the first meeting

Generally formed around buzzwords:

- GraphQL
- Serverless
- Microservices
- Monorepo / Lerna
- etc.
