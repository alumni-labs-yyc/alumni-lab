# Master minnion system
The master system has a diferent layout from the minion systems, including the minion systems as small windows around their workspace
The minions are set up by the Master, using either templates or made by pulling in modules to build the page
Examples:
- Dungeons and dragons:
 - The DM has access to the players character sheets and can modify them, send private messages to them(for example one of the players can hear a voice in their head so the master can talk through this system).
- Schools:
 - A teacher has access to all student systems, can monitor their activities and keep track of which students are falling behind, or can jump in to help explain things to students.
- IT company:
 - A manager who has multiple projects under them can see all projects progress, can jump in and give advice, join video chats with the teams etc
- Restaurants:
 - Each table could have a minion system where they can place orders, let the servers know when they are ready to pay, or order the next course, or get another drink
