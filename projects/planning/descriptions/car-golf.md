## Car Brick Golf
- As a user, I want to throw a brick at a car cause it gives me points
- As a user, if I miss, I want to throw the brick from where the brick has landed
- As a user, if I get the brick in the car, the round is over
- As a user, once the round is over, I want to know how many throws it took me to finish the round
- As a user, I'd like to start a new game.
- As a user, I'd like a variety of courses and a variety of cars.
- As a user, I'd like to play with my friends or against bots.
Features:
- wind effects trajectory
- pentalties for hitting people
- clubs are different sized people: toddler = putter, dwayne johnson = wood, etc
- higher level more points mean can buy different bricks => gold brick = elite
- I want a cute caddy mascot ( can also be a cat )
